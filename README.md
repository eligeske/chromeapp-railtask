# Rail Task chrome application

So many task apps, why another one? Missing features, or too many, this will be just right..... ┗(-_-)┛

Goal is to have tasks organized by project with a fast view to know if there is something to be done today or if any are worth money.

If you are like me and will not look at a task list if you have to open something then you may enjoy this. 

This will continually be worked onto to reach the maximum in-your-face experience.
